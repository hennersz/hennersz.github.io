This is a Tetris clone I started working on to learn more about the javascript canvas and games programming.
It currently implements the basic features of tetris: Moving shapes, clearing rows, scoring. I'd like to improve it further by adding the ability to drop a piece all the way to the bottom and showing a 'shadow' where the piece would land.
